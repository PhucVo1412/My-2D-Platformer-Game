## 🚀 Building Guide  
*(Step-by-step instructions to compile and run the game.)*  
I have built the game and zip it.
The zip folder is available at <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZloLToI593sduLz6wtCcJc0cOk31UYZ5/view?usp=sharing"> this link</a>.
Download the zip and compress it. Double click on Game2D.exe and enjoy the game.
